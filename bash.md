There are special files that do stuff when you set up Shell e.g Profile and Bashrc.

Google search these terms, for MAC.
 
They are hidden files (ie. .files). 
However, are visible if you use the ls -a  command in the terminal.

dot files tend to be configuration files. They can mostly be found in the home folder.
