There are special files that do stuff when you set up Shell e.g Profile and Bashrc.

Google search these terms, for MAC.
 
They are hidden files (ie. .files). 
However, are visible if you use the ls -a  command in the terminal.

.files tend to be configuration files. For example, you can find all the global git configeration at ~/.gitconfig.
