	  <h4>Jekyll</h4>
      <p>Jekyll allows you to create templates in which to store information that is repeated across pages in your site. New pages can then be based on a template. This means that when it comes to updating information that appears on several pages, you can just alter it on the template instead of having to alter a number of pages.</p>
      <p>There is very good <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/">documentation for Jekyll available online.</a></p>

      <h4>File structure</h4>
      <p>The _site folder is automatically generated by Jekyll. You shouldn't touch this. The site folder is a rendered version of all of your pages. It also moves all your css, images and javascript into this site folder. This is the product of Jekyll's work, the final output. 
      <h4>_layouts folder</h4>
      <p>The layouts folder will include your main templates. To refer to a layout you should write the following code at the top of your page: </br>
      <code>
      --- </br>
      layout: name of layout e.g. layout: default</br>
      ---
      </code> </p>
  </div>
  <div class="small-12 medium-4 large-4 columns">
      <h4>_includes folder</h4>
      <p>If you want to write nice modular code you would put these pieces in the _includes folder. </p>
      <p>To add an include to your file, use the following code: </br>
      <code>{include name.filetype %}</code></p>
