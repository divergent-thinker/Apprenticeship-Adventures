        <p>The below explains the basic structure of a loop, and a couple of different 
          ways of writing loops. First we begin with the basic example, and then we will look at an abbreviated version which is much more commonly used. </p>

      <p>A repeat loop is a control structure.  Another type of control structure is a conditional statement. That looks like this:</p>

      <code>if (boolean expression) {</br>
        conditional statement</br>
      }
      </code>

      <p>If the boolean expression is TRUE then the conditional statement will executed ONCE, and then we go to the next line of code underneath. </p>

      <p>The control structure of a <b>loop</b> is written just like this but with a different key word. There are two ways of doing this. The first way is as follows</p>

        <ol>
          <li><code><b>while</b> (boolean expression) {
          conditional statement</br>
          }</code></li>
          <p>
        </ol>

        <p>If the boolean expression is TRUE, then the conditional statement will be executed <b>MULTIPLE</b> times until it is not true, then it will go to the next line of code. 
        </p>

      <p>The danger is that your program will get stuck inside this loop. </br>
          Shorthand:</br>
          x=x+50 is so common that you might also find this kind of thing written:</br>
          x+=50
      </p>
      <p>x=x+1can also be written: x++
